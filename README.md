# Use Python to Analyze House Price
Python, PyCharm, PostgreSQL and Github

# Target of the project

In the past half year, I've been envolved in the learn of the STEM second degree. What fascinates my most are both its business and data oriented. I have had an strong interest in data and its potential since long ago. Seven years ago, I was using data to improve procedures internally. Five years ago, I began to use data to find buinesss opportunites to drive corporate growth and the collaboration between teams based on the insights from data.

Working on a 2 million rows of data in the past summer with Tableau , I was able to test the learning of Tableau, R, Forecasting and so on that I learnt at school. The beauty of data is always about how it will drive learning and growth for both individuals and corporate. Through the research project, I hope to stick to my interest, and further improve understanding about data and tools such as Python, PostpreSQl that I may use in future. This is the target of the project. Let's begin. 

# Choose my tools
-	Python-3.8.0.exe, download link: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/python-3.8.0.exe
-	PyCharm
-	PostgreSQL 12ï¼Œ
  The reasons why I chose PostgreSQl, rather than MySQL are as follows: 1) This project is a combination of Python and data preparation     from website.2) I have used MySQL before and want to try new one this time.
  
  Here is the users of the two databases by google "which company use postgresql". PostgreSQL: Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB, Macworld,       Debian, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Sun Microsystem, Cisco, Skype. See the full list here. MySQL: GitHub, US Navy, NASA, Tesla, Netflix, WeChat,     Facebook, Zendesk, Twitter, Zappos, YouTube, Spotify.For personal developer, there is basicly not difference between this two databases.

# Set up PyCharm
- Set up Python Interpreter. Follow the below steps in PyCharm Professional 2019.2 (Redfin is my project name)
  File - Settings - Project: Redfin - Project Interpreter - Python 3.8
  
- Avoiding the encoding problem. Follow the guidance to set up UTF-8 encoding 
  File - Settings - Editor - File Encodings - Set Global Encoding, Project Encoding, and Default encoding for properties files drop-down     list to UTF-8
- Use Hello World.py to test if PyCharm work now.
