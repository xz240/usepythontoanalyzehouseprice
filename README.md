# Target of the project

In the past half year, I've been envolved in the learn of the STEM second degree. What fascinates my most are both its business and data oriented. I have had an strong interest in data and its potential since long ago. Seven years ago, I was using data to improve procedures internally. Five years ago, I began to use data to find buinesss opportunites to drive corporate growth and the collaboration between teams based on the insights from data.

Working on a 2 million rows of data in the past summer with Tableau , I was able to test the learning of Tableau, R, Forecasting and so on that I learnt at school. The beauty of data is always about how it will drive learning and growth for both individuals and corporate. Through the research project, I hope to stick to my interest, and further improve understanding about data and tools such as Python, PostpreSQl that I may use in future. This is the target of the project. Let's begin.
